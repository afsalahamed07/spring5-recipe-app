Cut the avocado:
Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Score the inside of the avocado with a blunt knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.) Place in a bowl.

Mash the avocado flesh:
Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.)

Serve immediately:
If making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.)

Garnish with slices of red radish or jigama strips. Serve with your choice of store-bought tortilla chips or make your own homemade tortilla chips.
